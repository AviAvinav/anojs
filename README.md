# Ano.js Animations

Ano.js is a free, open source web animation library that makes creating beautiful designs a whole lot easier. Ano.js is designed in the interest of simplifying the process of creating and integrating web animations into your website. All of our animations are powered by open source contributions. If you are not already a contributor, you can be one now at [anojs.com/join-us](https://anojs.com/join-us) and entering your GitHub username.

## Why use Ano.js?
Ano.js was designed to be simple. Our team develops and optimizes the animations, so the user can use it in their website just by copy-pasting two lines of code! Instead of Anime.js and Mo.js where you have to code and create the animation yourself, we just did it for you!

## What do Ano.js contributors do?
Ano.js contributors are in charge to creating web animations and optimizing it so the users can use it. It is a great way to improve your skills while also being a part of a strong team.

## Why should I contribute?
All animations that you create give you recognition. The more contributions you make, the higher you will be ranked on the [Ano.js team page](https://anojs.com/our-team). Each animation you create will have your name next to it, and the more active you are the higher chance it is for you to be contacted for a staff position at Ano.js.

<b> All of the work you do here is up to you. </b> There are absolutely no time or effort commitments being a contributor. You can do as much or as little as you want as a contributor. But, more active contributors get to reap the rewards of being active.
