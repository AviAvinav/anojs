## Contribution Process
The way to contribute to Ano.js is very simple:
1. Create a web animation
    - Make whatever you want, you're the boss!
2. Optimize the animation
    - View the [OPTIMIZATION.md](OPTIMIZATION.md) for more information on this
3. Open a pull request
    - We will take a look at your animation. We will assess the following
      - Does the animation work?
      - Is it optimized properly?
      - Is it original?
4. Wait!
    - If your pull request is accepted, your animation will be deployed directly (with your name on it) to the website and users can start using it!
    - If your pull request is rejected, we will specifically tell you why so you can fix it and make another pull request.


## Contribution Rules
- Comment your code
- Make your code readable
- Use the [Ano.js optimization techniques](OPTIMIZATION.md)
